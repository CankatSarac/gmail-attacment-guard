# Privacy Policy for Gmail Attachment Guard

**Last updated: June 5, 2025**

## Data Collection and Usage

Gmail Attachment Guard is designed with privacy as a core principle. Here's what you need to know:

### What Data We DON'T Collect:
- ❌ We do not read, store, or transmit your email content
- ❌ We do not collect personal information
- ❌ We do not track your browsing behavior
- ❌ We do not share data with third parties
- ❌ We do not store data on external servers

### What the Extension Does:
- ✅ Scans email text **locally** for attachment-related keywords
- ✅ Shows warnings **only on your device**
- ✅ Stores user preferences **locally** in your browser
- ✅ All processing happens **entirely on your computer**

### Permissions Used:
- **Host Permission (mail.google.com)**: Required to interact with Gmail interface
- **Storage Permission**: Used only to save your language preferences locally

### Data Processing:
1. When you compose an email, the extension scans the text for keywords like "attachment", "attached", etc.
2. This scanning happens entirely within your browser
3. No email content ever leaves your device
4. If keywords are found but no attachment is present, a warning dialog appears

### Local Storage:
The extension may store minimal preferences (like language settings) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data:
- Remains on your device
- Is not transmitted anywhere
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension

### Third-Party Services:
The extension includes an optional "Buy Me a Coffee" link to support the developer. Clicking this link will take you to an external website (coff.ee), which has its own privacy policy.

### Changes to Privacy Policy:
Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in extension updates with appropriate version numbering.

### Contact:
For privacy-related questions, you can reach out through the Chrome Web Store support section.

**In Summary**: Gmail Attachment Guard operates entirely on your device and never accesses, stores, or transmits your personal data or email content. Your privacy is completely protected.
